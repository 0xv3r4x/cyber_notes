# Data Exfiltration

Most external and internal engagements prohibit taking data from compromised systems.  The goal of exfiltration is to remove data, such as passwords, keys, customer/employee data, from a compromised target.

DNS is commonly used as an exfiltration method as well as HTTPS due to its encryption - DNS-over-HTTPS is excellent at data exfiltration.  In addition, ICMP can also be used but can be very slow and even via email.
